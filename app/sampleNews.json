I regularly wear a 2015 Seiko that used to be 8 seconds per day fast but has fallen to 5 seconds per day slow so it is probably time to service it. My two newest watches are from 2017 and 2021 and they are consistent since break in. So given my limited number of data points, I would say 5-7 years between service but if you just want to wear it until it dies, 10+ years is probably reasonable.<p>On a side note, I have read about 40 year old Seikos being worn daily without service but that sure feels outside of the norm.",

If you look around you&#x27;ll find quite a few reports from people who bought the very first ones, and which are still ticking away virtually maintenance-free for 25+ years and counting. My own, a dive watch with around 10 years, which has actually been used for its stated purpose, is also still problem-free and with zero maintenance so far.<p>The only thing you need to be mindful of with Eco-Drives is that you can&#x27;t let it lose all charge. It can keep functioning in complete darkness for around 6 months, according to the specs, but if you do this enough times the battery will  lose the ability to hold charge and will need to be replaced, and there are plenty of reports to this effect. If you&#x27;re not planning on wearing it, just leave it somewhere that it can get natural light, instead of a drawer, and you should be good.<p>While mechanical watches are undoubtedly cool and elegant, they&#x27;re not perfect timekeepers, and when they do need maintenance it&#x27;s not something trivial which you can perform yourself. For my day-to-day watch I&#x27;ll take an accurate quartz movement with virtually zero maintenance any day. In other words an Eco-Drive, or something similar.",

It&#x27;s a pain but doable.<p>There are mobile apps that use the phone&#x27;s microphone to measure the watch&#x27;s &quot;ticks&quot; and graph them for you. They aren&#x27;t anywhere near as accurate as a &quot;real&quot; timegrapher but they&#x27;ll get you close enough.<p>At one point I had about a dozen mechanical watches. These days I have three, and only one that I wear almost exclusively. It&#x27;s a Maratac Mid-Pilot, which uses a Miyota 8245 movement. I&#x27;ve used the &quot;adjust and check later&quot; method to adjust it, and it loses about 10s per week - well within the acceptable range.<p>The other two that I&#x27;ve kept are a Seagull 1963, which I wear as a &quot;dress watch&quot;, and a Vostok Retro 1934, which I sometimes wear when I want a change of pace. It has a white face and I have a variety of brightly-colored straps for it.<p>One day I&#x27;ll step up and buy a Hamilton, but I&#x27;m still savoring the serotonin from looking at them and anticipating :).",

                            "text": "There&#x27;s Wikimedia Commons! It even (somewhat) addresses this particular issue by having a system for requesting specialized media-related edits—video editing, photo retouching, SVG editing, mapmaking, etc.<p>For the unaware, Commons, a repository of media files, is but one of many Wikimedia &quot;projects&quot; (including Wikipedia). It&#x27;s mostly used for images, but also hosts video, audio (including MIDI), 3D models (only STLs), and PDFs.Aside: considering what the Foundation seems to like doing, I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t do more to promote the &quot;other&quot; projects, especially to Wikipedia contributors—Wikipedia editors (even split by language) vastly outnumber those of the other projects, including Commons and Wikidata, which are multilingual.<p>Commons&#x27; request system connects those who recognize needed edits but cannot make them with those who check the requests pages and <i>are</i> able to. There&#x27;s the <i>Graphics Lab</i>[0] for edits to existing uploads, and <i>File requests</i>[1] for new uploads that are needed. Judging by the archives, they seem quite underutilized, though that might only be a sign of how few Commons contributors there are. Probably also has to do with the offloading of requests to local pages in many languages of Wikipedia.[2]<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commons:Graphic_Lab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commons:Graphic_Lab</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commons:File_requests\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commons:File_requests</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q5324355\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q5324355</a><p>There&#x27;s an interesting variation in the nature of barriers to being able to edit. Hardware and bandwidth cost money, but skills cost only time and software can be free. I&#x27;d say the Graphics Lab does decently in &quot;teaching how to fish&quot; through tutorials and lists of FOSS software. This contrasts with file requests, where there&#x27;s no equivalent, because the most common reason that someone can&#x27;t take a photo of something is that there physically aren&#x27;t any instances of it nearby.<p>This kind of barrier to contribution really isn&#x27;t specific to media; analogously, not everyone has access to the same resources for researching edits to Wikipedia. Wikimedia&#x27;s also trying to address that: everyone with &gt;10 monthly edits in any project has free access to the databases participating in The Wikipedia Library.[3] Most are relatively specialized, however (IIRC, JSTOR is the most generally useful of the lot).<p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Wikipedia_Library\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Wikipedia_Library</a>",

When I was a kid we would tinker around with watches in the basement but, alas, I had different interests and never really got around to truly understanding these mechanisms. I don&#x27;t really know web development beyond setting up basic pages, but how the CAD was integrated into this is wonderful and I&#x27;d love to see more posts going through things like human joints or ICE, or maybe weapons ... other things where we kind of intuitively <i>grasp</i> how they work, but don&#x27;t know the details. This entire blog seems to do a lot of that. So cool.",

Independent watchmakers usually go one of four routes:<p>1) Source a movement from a big manufacturer (eg; ETA&#x2F;Valjoux or a japanese&#x2F;chinese movement) and use it as is but design the case&#x2F;dial yourself\n2) (1) but modify the movement adding functionality, replacing parts, or refinishing it to your own standard\n3) Designing a custom movement around specialty movement parts from a supplier like Jaeger LeCoultre. They make some of the trickier parts (gears, balance springs). They can also manufacture special parts on a swiss screw machine.\n4) Going through a bespoke movement maker like agenhor. You tell them what you want and they have both the machinery to make many custom parts and source the rest from elsewhere. They also provide movement design expertise.<p>Actually machining the watch parts isn&#x27;t the hard part... the tricky part comes in things like hairsprings and escapements which are made from sometimes exotic materials like silicon. Some tiny watch parts are made using electrical discharge machining which costs $$$$$$$$ as well.",

Javascript can already dynamically load (additional) code files when needed, I don&#x27;t understand why you need to bundle it in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t buy that the http request overheads are so big that it motivates all this complexity, and in the average case a user don&#x27;t use every single page of the application anyway, so by bundling everything you are always serving &quot;too much&quot;, compared to just dynamically loading additional code.",

If you want to write pixel shaders in JS you can totally do that but you will have to run them on the CPU; as it happens I wrote a program last week that works that way: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canonical.org&#x2F;~kragen&#x2F;sw&#x2F;dev3&#x2F;trama\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canonical.org&#x2F;~kragen&#x2F;sw&#x2F;dev3&#x2F;trama</a>.  If you want to run them on the GPU you need a language that exposes the GPU&#x27;s capabilities.<p>In essence your primary complaint is that the GPU instruction set is not object-oriented (and neither is your database).  Well, you can design your own GPU, but I&#x27;ve got some bad news for you about Verilog, Chisel, and BlueSpec!  And you may find out that the real problem is that solid-state physics isn&#x27;t object-oriented, so your OO GPU will end up underperforming, like the Burroughs B5000 and the Symbolics 3600 (hopefully not as badly as the Intel iAPX432).  You&#x27;ll probably have more success writing an object-oriented database.<p>However, I do agree that WebGL is a bad API, because boilerplate is never acceptable.",

It&#x27;s basically how I learn things and I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s how most others acquire skills.<p>From my experience, the key issue is having an interest in the subject, subjects that I was interested in I did well in and it was the opposite for those that bored me. I suppose that makes sense but in both cases multiple passes were required before I became proficient - it&#x27;s just that it took considerably longer when my interest was less.<p>However, what I&#x27;ve noted on many occasions is that there are students who I&#x27;d classify as a class that are just good at learning things even if the subjects have little interest for them per se, they&#x27;re the ones who would often top the class and later in life you&#x27;d find them doing jobs unrelated to the subjects they did well in. I often think I&#x27;d like more of that trait.<p>For reasons I can only speculate about, my interest in certain specific subjects seems to have inate origins, it&#x27;s as if some <i>a priori</i> interest was there before I knew about them. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily bode well for other subjects that are deemed essential for one to become skilled in as one&#x27;s learning can become lopsided.<p>There&#x27;s little doubt that hands-on training works for most - and that brings me back to clocks. In physics practical classes on tension, springs, mechanical advantage, etc. we actually had clocks to experiment with. These were usually old bedroom alarm clocks and such that could be pulled apart and reassembled and if damaged it didn&#x27;t matter much. We all learned from these experiences, even kids with little mechanical aptitude as clocks contains just about every instance of the physics we were learning about and it was obvious how they all came together to make clocks work.",

Unfortunately, I was distracted by the somewhat irritating fact that I couldn&#x27;t view any of those drawings on two different smartphones (I could read the article but only saw white spaces where the drawings were supposed to be). It was only later when logged onto my PC that I could view them, and even then the whole page was sluggish and a pain to view. Perhaps those with faster equipment and or faster internet connection had better luck.<p>Thus, the thinly-veiled message behind my comment was a question about fitness for purpose—both about the subject matter and its method of delivery. My cynical inference was that if people today didn&#x27;t already understand the basics of gearing, mechanical advantage and escapement mechanisms etc. then something has gone wrong with the education system in that the basics of how clocks worked were well covered in physics (in mechanics) during my first year in high school—and that should not have changed as we <i>still</i> live and move around in a mechanical world—and thousands of industrial mechanical devices use these principles and rely on people having a good working knowledge of them.<p>By third year physics, everything relevant about the essential workings of a clock would also have been covered at a basic mathematical level: Hooke&#x27;s Law, gears and gear ratios, friction and simple harmonic motion. Even temperature expansion and contraction and the need to compensate for them was discussed (and in this context the physics teacher even discussed Harrison&#x27;s famous chronometer and how his design included temperature compensation to ensure that changes in these parameters did not impact heavily on time drift).<p>In essence, by third year, everything of important in that article had been covered in the school curriculum. If articles such as that under discussion are now being used to compensate for the lack of training in high school science then we have a serious problem with the education system.<p>Incidentally, even if one&#x27;s not interested in clock mechanisms, it&#x27;s worth having a look at this 19th Century publication on mechanical movements that&#x27;s on the Internet Archive (there are more types around than most people have ever likely considered: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;Mechanical_Movements_507\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;Mechanical_Movements_507</a>",

                "text": "Depends.  The ETA-2824 is a fairly common movement with inexpensive Chinese clones, so dials and hands are reasonably cheap and common.  If the target case also uses the same ETA movement then it’s simple:  Unscrew the back, remove the crown stem, drop the movement.  Assembly is the reverse of removal.<p>Where it gets tricky is if the target doesn’t use the same movement.  In that case, I’d just buy an AliExpress watch with the same dial size and an ETA clone movement.  Otherwise you have to ensure your target is the correct size and you’ll probably need to 3D print a movement holder.",

                "text": "That really depends on the sizes, if the face and movement are the same size I expect it should be easy enough. You will need some tools and fine motor skill, but no where near as much as you need when taking apart a movement.<p>Looking at the two watches you mention, the navigator has a Quartz Harley Ronda 373 movement and the diver has a ETA 2824-2 movement. The 373 I can&#x27;t find the specs for, but from an ebay auction it seems to be a 11½’’’ diameter. The 2824-2 is the same diameter. However, all 11½’’’ ronda quartz movements I can find are 3mm thick where the 2824 is 4.6mm. So what I&#x27;d expect is that it will fit, but you might not be able to secure it properly. It really depends on how the movement is held in place. Perhaps you can fabricate&#x2F;3d-print a spacer for that.<p>Another consideration is the lug stem, that might not be the right size. To long is solveable, to short means buying a replacement. I am also not sure wether the stems can have a different thickness, to thin and it wont be waterproof, to thick just won&#x27;t fit.<p>You could probably try without destroying anything (no guarantees ;)), you are not really touching any of the fragile &amp; tiny parts. But you will atleast need tool(s) to open the cases, they might be different, and a tiny screwdriver to release the lug. And I wouldn&#x27;t count on it remaining waterproof, not sure.",

Pocket watches are less so.  When I was interested in getting more intimate with watch repair, I went to eBay and bought up a whole bunch of old pocket watch movements.  I&#x27;ve got about 150 of them in various condition, most of them Waltham (easy to get, inexpensive, and I happen to have spent the first 25 years of my life spending a lot of time in the old Waltham Watch Co factory building because my father&#x27;s company leased out space in it).<p>Basic tools aren&#x27;t too bad, just a nice set of tweezers, screwdrivers, and a good magnifier is enough to do a lot of repairs.  But you can fall down the rabbit hole pretty quickly with the desire for increased quality tools and things like a staking set so you can replace balance wheel arbors.<p>I tried to move from the pocket watches into wrist watches, and while the technology is largely the same, the reduced size and increased complexity made it less enjoyable for me.  Instead I ended up moving the other direction and now have a nice collection of 18th and 19th century 30-hour and 8-day clocks (more commonly known as &quot;grandfather clocks&quot;).",

Most of the work is in the identification of parts, putting the watch together is really just like slapping a small sandwich together (minus putting the second hand on, that... is a test of dexterity, perseverance and commitment, the shaft you have to set it on is ~0.25mm).<p>Often a seller will be a small time watch maker and their components will all fit together, a good way to save on shipping.<p>Result: it&#x27;s become my favorite watch, I wear it every day.<p>Next project was to use a bunch of cheap clone parts and a 3d printed dial, still working on that one :)",

With thousands of engineers over several hundred years, however, it just feels like the natural evolution of things.<p>I feel that a lot of things happening in today&#x27;s society will be the &quot;watch&quot; in 100-200 years.

That pinion fits tightly inside its driving gear – it usually turns with that gear. However, when the driving gear can’t rotate because it’s blocked by the rest of the gear train, the cannon pinion can overpower the friction of that tight fit and rotate on its own. This lets us set time without interfering with the gear train, which could break the delicate parts.<p>Personally, I was wondering how one can wind the watch from the crown without engaging the weight of the autowinding mechanism.

It&#x27;s kind of sad how far we&#x27;re moving from watches which last hundreds of years as heirlooms with minimal maintenance, to electronic waste generating items with components made as cheaply as possible and at most last several years before their irreplaceable battery dies and you purchase another.<p>Watches are robust technologies that work without internet connectivity, are crafted&#x2F;maintained by people paying attention to mechanical parts that are sometimes about as thin as human hairs. Humans have used them for hundreds of years and they are really freaking cool.<p>If you think the animation is awesome(it is), consider owning the real thing.

Yes, it is!\nAnother masterpiece, then.<p>I&#x27;ve understand mechanical watch internals thanks to hundreds of hours of procrastination spent on watch-repairing youtube channels, but I wish I had such presentation several years ago.<p>Same with GPS - I&#x27;ve deep-dive into GPS when I&#x27;ve bought my first receiver, I think in year 2002 or something like this, and it was HARD at these times (there was Internet, of course, but good texts on GPS were very hard to find).<p>Now, thank you to Bartosz, I have two excellent links to hand out if I&#x27;m asked about these topics. I understand them well, but I never ever will be able to explain them so clear and accessible.",
